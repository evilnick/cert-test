# Overview

Canonical Kubernetes is developed to high standards of security and is designed
to be secure by default wherever possible.

Some of the CIS benchmark recommendations are dependent on factors outside of
the control of Canonical Kubernetes itself (for example, aspects of the host OS
or user settings). Therefore it is necessary for the user to take some steps to
ensure full compliance.

The following sections cover:

- The tested {doc}`status` of Canonical Kubernetes
- The {doc}`remediations` suggested by this status, which users would need to apply
- A full {doc}`reference` guide to the applicable CIS Benchmark
