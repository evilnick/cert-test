# Status

Canonical Kubernetes is developed to high standards of security and is designed
to be secure by default wherever possible.

Some of the CIS benchmark recommendations are dependent on factors outside of
the control of Canonical Kubernetes itself (e.g. aspects of the host OS). For
these known cases, remediations are linked in the following section of this
document.

To check the status of Canonical Kubernetes against the benchmark, we use 


```{include} ./_parts/kubebench.md
```

```{eval-rst}
.. raw:: latex
